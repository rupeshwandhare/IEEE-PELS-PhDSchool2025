      <h2>About PhD Summer School 2025</h2>
      <p>The theme of this year’s school is “Designing reliable control circuits for power converters”, 
        which is sponsored by IEEE Power Electronics Society (PELS). There will be a series of lectures 
        by renowned speakers from  India and abroad, delivering knowledge on the hardware/software design 
        of control circuits suitable for power converters. In addition, there will be Hands-On Sessions 
        on the schematic, layout design, testing of modern driver circuits for power devices, and 
        establishing reliable feedback mechanisms (signal conditioning circuits) for power converters. 
        A few sessions will be spared for the selected PhD Scholars in their 3rd/4th year of PhD to 
        present their research work for about 20 minutes, followed by a 10-minute Q&A. This will 
        enable scholars to prepare for their upcoming research defence. At the end of the workshop, 
        a few experimental kits will be awarded to deserving and outperforming participants 
        (through evaluation). Certificates will be provided to all participants who successfully 
        attend the Ph.D. Summer School.
